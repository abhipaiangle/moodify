    <h1>Hacktoberfest 2021</h1>
    <p>Hacktoberfest is great. This little change is a change in frontend of a application xD and I get a T-shirt! Yayy!</p>

    <p>The target of the project was  to build an app which is a music recommender that takes in your picture and then predicts your mood and accordingly suggests a music playlist for you on spotify.</p>
